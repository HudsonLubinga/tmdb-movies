# Project: The Movie Database (TMDb) data Analysis
In this Data Analysis project, I analyzed data about movies. This data was collected from The Movie Database (TMDb) dataset. The dataset analyzed contains over 10,000 pieces of movie information. In particular, we will be interested in finding genres that are most popular and highly rated from year to year and also to know what characteristics or properties contribute to the generation of high revenue by the movies.

## The project answered the following Question(s) for Analysis
1. What are the most popular genres from year 1966 to year 2015?
2. Which movie genre is the most highly rated in each year?
3. What are the kinds of properties associated with high revenue movies?

## I used the following libraries:
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv
