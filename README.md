# tmdb-movies
In this project, we will be analyzing data about movies. This data is collected from The Movie Database (TMDb) dataset. The dataset analyzed contains over 10,000 pieces of movie information. In particular, we will be interested in finding genres that are most popular and highly rated from year to year and also to know what characteristics or properties contribute to the generation of high revenue by the movies.
